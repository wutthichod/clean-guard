"""Triage rules (M10, A). Decide as many files as possible without the LLM.

| # | Rule                                         | Result                    |
| 1 | path matches a protected pattern             | keep                      |
| 2 | modified_days < min_age_days_for_delete      | keep (recent)             |
| 3 | name has a privacy signal                    | -> LLM, then PRIVACY      |
| 4 | name matches junk_names                      | deletable                 |
| 5 | partial download older than 7 days           | deletable                 |
| 6 | exact duplicate (dup_of set)                 | deletable                 |
| 7 | everything else                              | -> LLM                    |

Rule 3 sits before junk and duplicate rules on purpose: a duplicate of a passport scan is
judged by the model and the privacy pass, not silently marked deletable.
